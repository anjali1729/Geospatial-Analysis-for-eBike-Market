Spatial analysis for E-bike market in Singapore

With the increase in bike sharing in Singapore, issue of bikes parked randomly at bus
stops, dock less, at pavement meant for public places or some even dumped at unwanted
location and drains, has been observed. Unfortunately, this problem of indiscriminate
parking is causing inconvenience to public and pedestrians. It also introduces a complex
issue of bikes being left at locations at which they may pose a hazard or impede pedestrian
traffic. Moreover, there is no guarantee that the location is easily accessible.
This geospatial analysis is for a new e-bike company who wants to enter the bike sharing
market with a new e-bike product which runs on battery. These e-bikes can run at faster
speed and take less space to park. This will be solving the problem stated above by
introducing the fixed docking stations for e-bikes at various locations of the city. Each of
these stations has a fixed capacity (typically around 20 e-bikes). Customers can swipe a
card at the docking station to get access to the e-bike, and they drop it off at another
station near their destination. These docking stations will be having an in-build charging
point as well which will help to charge the e-bike once it is parked at the station. By doing
a spatial analysis we aim to find the market for e-bikes in the city.
